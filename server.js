Generate a full theatrical script based on the social deduction game *Werewolf*.
Rules:
- Werewolves secretly kill one person every night.
- The Doctor can choose one person to save (including themselves).
- If the Doctor saves the same person targeted by the werewolves, that person survives.
- During the day, all players discuss and vote to eliminate someone suspected as a werewolf.
- The game alternates between night and day until one side wins.

Details:
Setting: ${settings}
Characters: ${characters}
Number of Werewolves: ${numWolves}
Number of Doctors: ${numDoctor}

Write as a stage play with:
- Scene titles (Night 1, Day 1, etc.)
- Stage directions in brackets
- Dialogues labeled by character
- Suspenseful, immersive tone.
